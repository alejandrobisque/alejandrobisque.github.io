<p>
ALEJANDRO BISQUE, GETTING AN A IN HIS COLLEGE WRITING COURSE, FIRST STARTED WRITING STORIES WITH CHALK ON THE SIDEWALK. THE SAME THING HE HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO DO WAS WRITE. HIS GOAL AND HIS PROCESS WAS TO CREATE NOVELS THAT WERE THRILLING, FICTIONAL STORIES. ALEJANDROO SAYS GOING TO COLLEGE WAS THE BEST THING HE'S EVER DONE. EVEN THOUGH HIS COURSES WERE IN LINQUISTICS, HIS WRITING NEVER QUIT FOLLOWING HIM THERE. HIS WRITING FOLLOWED HIM EVERY WHERE HE WENT, IT SEEMED.<p> 
AFTER TENDING TO THE FIELDS IN HIS GRANDFATHERS FARM FOR MANY YEARS, HE CAME INTO THE CITY AND LEARNED TO GROW UP IN THE SUBURBS. THERE, HIS WRITING PROCESS CONTINUED. HE SEAMLESSLY GREW AND LEARNED THROUGH HIS OWN WRITINGS. BRINGING HIS SKILL TO AN ACOMMADOTABLE MEDIUM SO THAT OTHERS COULD ENJOY HIS NOVELS, SO WE CREATED THIS WEBSITE.</p>
